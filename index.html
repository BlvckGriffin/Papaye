        <h3 class="about">Chicken Trivia</h3>
        <p><details >Ancient Origins: Chickens were first domesticated over 8,000 years ago in Southeast Asia. They are descendants of the wild red junglefowl.

            World Population: There are more chickens on Earth than any other bird species. In fact, there are more chickens than humans, with an estimated population of over 25 billion!
            
            Egg Production: A hen can lay around 300 eggs per year. The color of the eggshell is determined by the breed of the chicken‚Äîwhite-feathered chickens with white earlobes lay white eggs, while red-feathered chickens with red earlobes lay brown eggs.
            
            Communication: Chickens have a complex communication system with over 30 different vocalizations to distinguish between threats and to communicate with each other.
            
            Memory: Chickens have excellent memories and can recognize over 100 different faces, including humans.
            
            Speedy Runners: Chickens can run up to 9 miles per hour. They use their wings to help them balance while running.
            
            Social Hierarchy: Chickens establish a social hierarchy known as the "pecking order." This determines the social standing of each bird within the flock.
            
            Vision: Chickens have better vision than humans. They can see a broader range of colors and can even see ultraviolet light.
            
            Dust Baths: Chickens take dust baths to keep their feathers clean and free from parasites. They roll around in the dirt, which helps to absorb excess oil and remove pests.
            
            Lifespan: The average lifespan of a chicken is 5 to 10 years, but some chickens can live up to 15 years or more with proper care.
            
            I hope you enjoyed these chicken tidbits! üêî</details></p>
